# Ambient-Volume
*Marihacks 2018 candidate*

--------------------------------------

Ever had been in the metro with your headphones, but have your favourite track being cut off from the incoming metro train? At times like these, the only wish crossing our mind is to have our phone automatically adjust its volume to fit the ambience.

This Android app detects your environment's sound amplitude, then adjusts your phone's volume accordingly in order to not let you miss any note of your favourite track, even on a noisy airplane, cruising at 900km/h.

--------------------------------------

### To-do list:
- [ ] Reorganize the UIto be less of an eyesore.
- [ ] Run this program as a background service.
- [ ] Implement notification & widget control.
- [ ] Setting to specify the behaviour of the app after the user manually changed the volume.
- [ ] :sparkles: In the far future :sparkles: : setting to automatically pause phone's currently streaming sound when an ambient music is detected.
